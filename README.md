ISM3232 Coding Challenge 6.

Introduction: In this challenge, you will create a simple employee shift management system for a small business. The system will track employee shift schedules, check availability, assign shifts, and calculate total hours worked for each employee. Youâ€™ll use objects to represent employees and shifts, arrays to store multiple employees and shift schedules, and array/object methods to manipulate the data.

Scenario: A small business wants to manage its employee shift schedules. They need a system that: 1. Tracks employees and their assigned shifts. 2. Checks employee availability based on their existing shifts. 3. Assigns new shifts to available employees. 4. Calculates the total hours worked by each employee for the week.
